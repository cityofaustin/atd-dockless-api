# Binary Library Folder

This folder was created to allocate the installation of libspatialindex in a Lambda function.

These files were compiled and extracted from the [LambCI Docker-Lambda](https://github.com/lambci/docker-lambda)
image and bundled with this repo for CI convenience.

Do not remove these files as the API will crash without them.
